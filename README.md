# educational-interactive-tool
This an interactive website teaching about centralized and decentralized algorithms.

This website is meant to be used on a computer, it is not safe for phone or tablet.

# Usage
## Hosted site
This is the website: https://cps706-group-15.github.io/educational-interactive-tool/

It contains different tabs to explain both centralized and decentralized algorithms.

It also has guides around the website to help the user understand everything.

## Local server
In the local repository, the index.html in root folder should be opened using chrome or edge.

From there you should follow the guides around the website to utilize it.

### Decentralized:
1. Choose the amount of routers and click submit

2. Pick a source and destination router, click submit to see the algorithm run 
    and after click details to see the new updated routing table after the algorithm ran

3. Scroll down to change path weights, click submit to see the svg to update, 
    reset to go back to previous weights and go back to scroll up

4. Run step 2 again


### Usage for Centralized Algorithm :
1.    Choose router

2.    Set Link Weights

3.    Enter source and Destination 

4.    Click Run button to run the Dijkstra Algorithm

5.    Click Reset to reset the page
